# DL-guided-RRM-construction
Supporting code for the paper "Deep learning guided rainfall-runoff model construction"
The Python portion of the code is used for training the network, while the MATLAB portion is used to optimize the newly designed hydrological model. The Python code depends on "洪水.xlsx" to run, whereas the MATLAB code can be executed directly.
python部分代码用于训练网络，matlab部分的代码用于优化新设计的水文模型。python部分的代码依赖于“洪水.xlsx”运行，matlab部分的代码可以直接运行。
